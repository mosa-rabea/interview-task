- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
* Z-score: is a statistical measure of the relationship of score to mean in a set of scores
  It is calculated based on the mean and standard deviation ,
  we use it to compare two different values with different environments.
 -For example, like comparing the mark of two students, which is better, knowing that each student is in a different class

* Min-Max scaling: It consists of rescaling the range of features to scale in [0, 1] or [-1, 1].
 The choice of the target range depends on the nature of the data.
 we use it to transform features by scaling each feature to a given range.
```

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
* Why it's good to use junit5 library ?
  JUnit5 has added some useful new features for organizing, and executing tests.

* What is unit testing in java ?
  Testing the smaller units of your application.
  
* Why it's good to use unit testing in java ?
  Ensures that all code meets quality standards before it's deployed.
